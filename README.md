# Senior-Project
# Milestone 1 was to create a scene for the player to explore but there are no out of bounds 
# Milestone 2 was to get the player a working character with a working gun to fire balls to shoot targets around the level
# Milestone 3 was get the balls to collide with the targets (cubes) without them phasing through the entire map
